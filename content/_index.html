<p>I’m Toju (pronounced <em>toe-joo</em>), an <a href="https://www.actuaries.org.uk">actuary</a> from Lagos and London currently living in Oslo. Learning <code>R</code> has had a profound impact on my career and has changed my life. This blog is a way for me to give back and to journal what I learn.</p>
<p>I’ll mostly write about cool little <code>R</code> tips I learn and also my thoughts behind some data visualisations I come across or create. And football. Plenty of football. 😄</p>
