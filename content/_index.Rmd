I'm Toju (pronounced *toe-joo*), an [actuary](https://www.actuaries.org.uk) from Lagos and London currently living in Oslo. Learning `R` has had a profound impact on my career and has changed my life. This blog is a way for me to give back and to journal what I learn.

I'll mostly write about cool little `R` tips I learn and also my thoughts behind some data visualisations I come across or create. And football. Plenty of football. `r emo::ji("smile")`
