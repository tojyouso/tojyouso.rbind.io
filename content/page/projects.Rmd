#### R Packages

+ [footballdataR](https://github.com/tojyouso/footballdatar): helper functions to download football data from [football-data.co.uk](http://www.football-data.co.uk)

#### Shiny apps

Still need to sort out a proper domain to host these but here are a couple of `shiny` apps I've created:

+ [leagueViz](http://167.99.82.189:3838/football/league_viz/): an interactive app to visualise the league table in each of the main European leagues `r emo::ji("bicep")`

+ [leagueProj](http://167.99.82.189:3838/football/league_proj_viz/): an interactive app to visualise each team's performance this season versus previous seasons. Only for the Premier League at the moment `r emo::ji("call")`
