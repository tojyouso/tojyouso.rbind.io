<p>Last Monday, I gave my first ever talk at userR! Oslo and I really enjoyed it. Was quite nervous all weekend because I felt I was presenting to a lot of people who knew a lot more about this than I did.</p>
<p>I volunteered to do this for three reasons.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>I wanted to stretch myself and improve my presentation skills</li>
<li>I wanted to explore <code>tidymodels</code></li>
<li>And finally, I wanted to actually <em>finish</em> one of my football analyses.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some things I learnt through this whole process</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Don’t overcomplicate things! It’s very difficult to convey really technical details so simple examples are key</li>
<li>Bring the data to life - it was a last minute decision to put some video of footbal events to help describe the data and I had underestimated how much that helped the audience understand what I was saying</li>
<li>Slow down! This is big for me, I read recently that even though a 5 second pause feels like eternity to you while up there it is great for the audience to digest</li>
<li>Get there early so you can meet others who are early and develop a rapport. This way, they won’t seem so daunting! Also gives you a chance to test out your equipment and make sure everyone can see your slides from the back of the room</li>
<li>Make it personal. I had gifs and memes in there which did two things. One, made the audience laugh and two gave me some natural breaks.</li>
<li>Time time time. This I completely failed on, I thought I wouldn’t have enough to say but I actually went over my time so it’s important to time your talk while you practise.</li>
<li>If you can, invite some friends/colleagues. I invited someone and it was great to have a friendly face in the audience</li>
</ol>
<p>All in all, I recommend it. And if you’re in Oslo, they are looking for more speakers from all walks of life and all levels.</p>
<p>So here are the <a href="https://tojyouso.rbind.io/slides/how_to_score_a_goal#1">slides</a></p>
