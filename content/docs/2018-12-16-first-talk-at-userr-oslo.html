<p>So last Monday, I gave my first ever talk at <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Oslo-useR-Group/events/255853637/">userR! Oslo</a>.</p>
<p>If you’ve come just for the slides, you can find them <a href="https://tojyouso.rbind.io/slides/how_to_score_a_goal#1">here</a> otherwise I wrote up a short post on why I did this:</p>
<p>I volunteered to do this for four reasons.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>I wanted to stretch myself and improve my presentation skills</li>
<li>I wanted to explore <code>tidymodels</code></li>
<li>I want to get to know the <code>R</code> community better. Both to give back and also to work with other people</li>
<li>And finally, I wanted to actually <em>finish</em> one of my football analyses.</li>
</ol>
<p>There were also lots of things I learnt while preparing for and giving this talk. Here’s a quickly written list. It’s not ordered in any way:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Don’t overcomplicate things! It’s very difficult to convey really technical details so simple examples are key.</li>
<li>The weekend before the talk, I had serious <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">imposter syndrome</a> but I assure you that there will be at least one person who will learn something from you. Also the audience was very wecloming and I learnt a lot from other peoples comments and questions.</li>
<li>Bring the data to life - it was a last minute decision to put some video of football events to help describe the data and I had underestimated how much that helped the audience understand what I was saying.</li>
<li>Slow down! This is big for me. I read recently that even though a 5 second pause feels like eternity to you while up there but it is great for the audience to digest the content.</li>
<li>Get there early so you can meet others who are early and develop a rapport. This way, they won’t seem so daunting! Also gives you a chance to test out your equipment and make sure everyone can see your slides from the back of the room.</li>
<li>Make it personal. I had gifs and memes in there which did two things. One, made the audience laugh and two they gave me some natural breaks.</li>
<li>Time time time. This I completely failed on, I thought I wouldn’t have enough to say but I actually went over my time so it’s important to time your talk while you practise.</li>
<li>If you can, invite some friends/colleagues. I invited someone and it was great to have a friendly face in the audience.</li>
<li>Maybe not so much heavy code slides at the end of the presentation and so late in the day. I saw a few yawns as I was wrapping up.</li>
<li>Finally, make sure you have enough water with you. An hour of almost non stop talking is a very long time.</li>
</ol>
<p>All in all, I recommend it. And if you’re in Oslo, <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Oslo-useR-Group/">they</a> are looking for more speakers from all walks of life and all levels.</p>
