<p>I recently read a story on the <a href="">guardian</a> about the last male northern white rhino who died last week effectively rendering the species extinct. I had never heard of a northern white rhino so googled to see what it looked like and what kind of rhinos exist. So it turns out there are five main types of rhinos: <em>white</em> , <em>black</em>, <em>Indian</em>, <em>Javan</em> and <em>Sumatran</em>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Here’s a picture of each one.</p>
<p>They are awesome animals aren’t they.</p>
<p>I was interested in this for a couple of reasosn:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>It’s a sad story that I wanted to further highlight</li>
<li>It’s one of my dreams to go on safari</li>
<li>I think rhinos are incredible animlas - their size, the thick grey hide and those majestic horns</li>
<li>I want to highlight great things about Africa</li>
<li>I thought writing this would give me a chance to practise some <code>R</code> skills</li>
</ol>

<h2>White rhinos</h2>
<p>First of all, <em>white</em> has nothing to do with their colour as you can see above, they are actually grey like most rhinos. They are called <em>white</em> because early English South African speakers settling in Africa mistook the German word <em>wijd</em> meaning wide (as in wide mouthed rhino) for <em>white</em>. The wide mouth is the main difference between the white rhinos and the black rhinos.</p>
<p>White rhinos can be further subdivided into two subspecies: northern and southern. The northern is smaller, less hairy and has a smaller horn.<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>To really understand how large these animals (northern white rhinos) are I created a couple of small charts comparing them to me.</p>
