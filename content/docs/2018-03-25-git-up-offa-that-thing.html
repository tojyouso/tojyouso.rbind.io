<p>To get my site working properly, I finally had to learn <code>git</code>. I am now in love with it. I don’t know how I’ve lived without it for so long. I mean, I’ve known about it for a couple of years and started using it a little about 18 months ago but it was like I wasn’t ready. It was because I didn’t really understand how to use it.</p>
<div id="my-favourite-resources" class="section level2">
<h2>My favourite resources</h2>
<p>Here are a couple of resources (<code>R</code> related of course) I always have handy:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><a href="http://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/">Karl Broman’s tutorial</a>: this is simple and straight to the point. Best resource for anyone who wants to get up and started quickly with <code>git</code>.</li>
<li><a href="http://happygitwithr.com">Great book by Jenny Bryan</a>: This is an entire book with some awesome workflows.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="other-tips" class="section level2">
<h2>Other tips</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Using <code>.gitignore</code> which is a text file where you can specify files and folders that <code>git</code> will ignore when you use <code>git add .</code></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="things-to-remember---my-workflow" class="section level2">
<h2>Things to remember - my workflow</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><code>git clone &quot;repository link&quot;</code>: to link the repository to github</li>
<li><code>touch .gitignore</code>: ceates the <code>gitignore</code> text file</li>
<li><code>git add .</code>: this adds all changes in this directory</li>
<li><code>git commit -m &quot;commit message&quot;</code>: commits the files with commit message: “commit message”</li>
<li><code>git push</code>: uploads my stuff to the repository</li>
</ol>
<p>OR, just use RStudio, they’ve built it all in.</p>
<p>That’s all for now but I will continue to edit this post as I get better at using <code>git</code>.</p>
